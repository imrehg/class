1) Find all pizzas eaten by at least one female over the age of 20.
\project_{pizza} (
((\project_{name} Person)
 \diff 
 (\project_{name} 
  \select_{gender<>'female' or age <= 20} Person) \join Eats))

2) Find the names of all females who eat at least one pizza served by Straw Hat.
\project_{name} (\project_{name, pizza} (\select_{gender='female'} Person \join Eats) \join \project_{pizza} (\select_{pizzeria='Straw Hat'} Serves))

3) Find all pizzerias that serve at least one pizza for less than $10 that either Amy or Fay (or both) eat.
\project_{pizzeria} (\select_{price<10} (Serves \join \project_{pizza} (\select_{name='Amy' or name='Fay'} Eats)))

4) Find all pizzerias that serve at least one pizza for less than $10 that both Amy and Fay eat. 
\project_{pizzeria} (\select_{price<10} (Serves \join (\project_{pizza} (\select_{name='Amy'} Eats) \join \project_{pizza} (\select_{name='Fay'} Eats))))

5) Find the names of all people who eat at least one pizza served by Dominos but who do not frequent Dominos.
\project_{name} (Eats \join \project_{pizza} (\select_{pizzeria='Dominos'} Serves)) \diff \project_{name} (\select_{pizzeria='Dominos'} Frequents)

6) Find all pizzas that are eaten exclusively by people younger than 24, or that cost less than $10 everywhere they're served. 
(\project_{pizza} Serves) \diff (\project_{pizza}(\select_{price>=10} Serves)) \union (\project_{pizza} (\project_{name} (\select_{age<24} Person) \join Eats) \diff \project_{pizza} (\project_{name} (\select_{age>=24} Person) \join Eats))

(The union has to be in this order, opposite does only return one element, why?)

7) Find the age of the oldest person (or people) who eat mushroom pizza. 
\project_{age} (\project_{n1} \select_{n1<>n2 and a1>=a2}((\rename_{n1,a1} \project_{name, age} \select_{pizza='mushroom'} (Person \join Eats)) \cross (\rename_{n2,a2}\project_{name, age} \select_{pizza='mushroom'} (Person \join Eats)))
\diff
\project_{n1} \select_{n1<>n2 and a1<a2}((\rename_{n1,a1} \project_{name, age} \select_{pizza='mushroom'} (Person \join Eats)) \cross (\rename_{n2,a2}\project_{name, age} \select_{pizza='mushroom'} (Person \join Eats))) \join \rename_{n1,age,gender} Person)


8) Find all pizzerias that serve only pizzas eaten by people over 30. 
\project_{pizzeria} (Serves \join \project_{pizza} (\select_{age>30} Person \join Eats)) \diff
\project_{pizzeria} (Serves \join (\project_{pizza} Serves \diff \project_{pizza} (\select_{age>30} Person \join Eats)))

9) Find all pizzerias that serve every pizza eaten by people over 30. 
\project_{pizzeria} (Serves \join \project_{pizza} (\select_{age>30} Person \join Eats))
\diff
\project_{pizzeria} (\project_{pizzeria} Serves \cross \project_{pizza} (\select_{age>30} Person \join Eats) \diff \project_{pizzeria, pizza} (Serves \join \project_{pizza} (\select_{age>30} Person \join Eats)))
